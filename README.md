# calculator
In this project, I will be combining everything I've learned so far: making an 
on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

For now, the calculator can only do one basic operation (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division) on two numbers at a time. You can also continue to do
any operation on the result. Keyboard support is also available.
